# ⚽Real Time Data Warehouse Streaming

This repository contains the code and configuration for the **EURO 2024 Real-Time Data Streaming and Visualization** project. 
The project leverages a real-time data pipeline to stream football data (teams, players, matches, groups, and events) from an API into Kafka. 
The data is processed and stored in **Apache Pinot** for fast analytics and visualized using **Apache Superset**.

## 🛠 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build and manage a **real-time data warehouse** using modern tools and technologies. 
The data includes dynamic football statistics like live match events, player performance, and group standings for EURO 2024.

### 🚀 Key Components

- **Apache Kafka**: Message broker used for real-time streaming of data.
- **Apache Pinot**: OLAP data store for fast querying and analytics.
- **Apache Superset**: Data visualization platform to create dashboards and monitor statistics.
- **Apache Airflow**: Workflow orchestration for automated data extraction and streaming.

## 📋 Architecture

The project consists of the following pipeline:

1. **API Extraction**: Data is fetched from a JSON-based API.
2. **Kafka Streaming**: Extracted data is streamed into Kafka topics.
3. **Processing with Pinot**: Kafka feeds the data into Apache Pinot for storage and querying.
4. **Visualization in Superset**: Real-time dashboards are created to visualize football statistics.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

### 🛑 Prerequisites

- Create a RapidAPI Account
  - Visit the [EURO 2024 API on RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/yuvr99-WHTEITBQbOc/api/euro-20242).
  - Sign up or log in to your RapidAPI account.
  - Subscribe to the API Gateway and obtain your API key.
- Add the RapidAPI Key
  - Navigate to the constants.py file in the utils/ directory.
  - Add your RapidAPI key in the following format:
    ```
    RAPIDAPI_KEY = "your-rapidapi-key"
    ```
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- Apache Kafka, Pinot, and Superset configured.
- Airflow environment set up with Python 3.10.

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/euro-2024-kafka-pinot-pipeline.git
   cd euro-2024-kafka-pinot-pipeline
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Build the Docker File**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t euro-2024-kafka-pinot-pipeline .
   ```
4. **Start the Docker containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
5. **Access Superset**:
   - Visit `http://localhost:8088` in your browser.

6. **Launch Airflow**:
   - Visit `http://localhost:8080` to view and manage DAGs.

## 💡Usage

- **Airflow DAGs** orchestrate the extraction of data from the API and stream it to Kafka.
- **Pinot** stores the streamed data for fast querying.
- **Superset Dashboards** visualize the real-time statistics, offering insights into player performance, match events, and group standings.

## 📊 Topics and Schemas

- **players**: Contains player statistics like goals, assists, and appearances.
- **teams**: Stores team details such as coach, captain, and championships.
- **matches**: Holds match details including scores, lineups, and winners.
- **groups**: Tracks group standings, points, and goal differences.
